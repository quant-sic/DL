# Deep Learning Algorithms Suite

Implementations of various deep learning algorithms and working examples. 
The Framework leverages Cuda device for parallel computing. The basic structure is written in C++.
Additionally there is Python binding available using pybind11.

## Build
    
- The Build system used to make the project is CMake. By invoking cmake on the top level CMakeLists.txt file, the project is made.

## Hardware

- In the development phase the algorithms are tested on the Nvidia Quadro K4400 https://www.nvidia.com/content/PDF/data-sheet/DS_NV_Quadro_K4000_OCT13_NV_US_LR.pdf.

## Network Architectures
    
- Dense Layer
